# Data-structure

Implementation of several data structures through C++ language

The aim of this project is only for indivual learning, once the most part of this data structures were already implementated in C++ Standard Library. With this project, I hope to: 

- Understand deeply how each data structure works
- Improve C++ skills
- Improve OOP skills
- Accostum with Github usage, as well as with the convetional commits
- Develop a critical look about time and space complexity 


The main idea is implementate the following data structures:
- Queue
- Stack
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph
- Array
- Hash Table
